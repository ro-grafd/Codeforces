1) Get very familiar with built-in stl functions of C++
2) Mathematics to focus on :
    a) HCF (gcd)
    b) LCM
    c) Primes
    d) Divisors
    e) Multiples
    f) modular Arithmatic
    g) fermet euler torient and modular inverse


TIPS
i) NO NEW TOPICS !!!!!
ii) Implementation skills have to increase via ADHOCS & Greedy
iii) Get to know the standard ad-hoc problems or first principles
     to get familiar with specific kind of problems


New techniques learnt
i) gcd(x, y) = gcd(x - y, y) if x > y
ii) Count and reset technique ( c - k + 1)
iii) i | x == x , submask of x or not 
iv) rotate(perm.begin() + left, perm.begin() + right, perm.begin() + right + 1); 
    rotate(first, mid, last);
    first: Iterator to the first element in the range.
    mid: Iterator to the element that becomes the new first element.
    last: Iterator to the theoretical element just after the last element in the range.
v) lower_bound(x) in vector,set,multiset... gives the least value that is greater than equal to x or not less than x.
vi) *s.begin() gives the first value of a Container(vector, set, multiset) similarily *s.rbegin() gives largest
    *s.end() is NOT the last value, its the value after the last. ( sentinel value *not to be dereferenced*)


Questions
1) Should I still the solution walkthrough even though i managed to solve in contest and upsolve as well??
2) Currently i am able to solve almost A and B, except those permutation question. You know any resources or question from where i can practice for it?
3) So now for some C,D questions in CP31 1000 list, I am able to come up with the intuition just because I've grinded LC since 6 months, due to that reason
   I am using unordered_map,sets, accumulate function as well. So thats fine right ?? or should do with vector<int> itself instead of unordered_map<int, int> for counting and stuff
