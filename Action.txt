1) Get very familiar with built-in stl functions of C++
2) Mathematics to focus on :
    a) HCF (gcd)
    b) LCM
    c) Primes
    d) Divisors
    e) Multiples
    f) modular Arithmatic



TIPS
i) NO NEW TOPICS !!!!!
ii) Implementation skills have to increase
iii) get to know the standard ad-hoc problems or first principles
     to get familiar with specific kind of problems




New techniques learnt
i) gcd(x, y) = gcd(x - y, y) if x > y
ii) Count and reset technique ( c - k + 1)
ii)
